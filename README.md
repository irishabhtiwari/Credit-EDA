- The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming a defaulter. 
- In this project used EDA to analyse the patterns present in the data and this will ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

<h2> ‚ö°Ô∏è Business Objectives</h2>
</b>This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. </b>

## ‚è≥ Dataset

<h4>This dataset has 3 files as explained below :</h4> 

<ul>
<li><b>'application_data.csv'</b> contains all the information of the client at the time of application.
The data is about whether a client has payment difficulties.

<li><b>'previous_application.csv'</b> contains information about the client‚Äôs previous loan data. It contains the data on whether the previous application had been Approved, Cancelled, Refused or Unused offer.

<li><b>'columns_description.csv'</b> is data dictionary which describes the meaning of the variables.
</ul>
